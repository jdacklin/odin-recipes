# odin-recipes

In this project I will be creating a recipe webpage following the odin project curriculum. In this webpage I will display knowledge of creating html from scratch as well as boilerplate, creating headings using h1-h6 tags, adding images, the use of paragraph tags, unordered and ordered list, as well as anchor tags to link pages together.
